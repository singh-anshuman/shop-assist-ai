    """
    Calls a specified function repeatedly and prints the results.
    This function is designed to test the consistency of a response from a given function.
    It calls the function multiple times (default is 10) and prints out the iteration count,
    the function's response(s).
    Args:
        funct (function): The function to be tested. This function should accept a single argument
                          and return the response value(s).
        debug_response (dict): The input argument to be passed to 'funct' on each call.
        num (int, optional): The number of times 'funct' will be called. Defaults to 10.
    Returns:
        This function only returns the results to the console.
